Dog Breeds DB Filtering Exercise
--------------------------------

In /resources/, there is "dogs.sql" ( a DB table). Please login to phpMyAdmin, select your database, then Import this table.

The "dogs_sql.jpg" is just a screen capture for you to reference as you go thru the exercise. Do  NOT try to make your own table from this (see above :).

Setup your "mysql_connect.php" script.


In the "index.php" file, go thru the comments and complete to the best of your ability. 
Phil will go thru this in class after.

Phil will then go thru "widgets.php" in class as well.
